Sara Pernille Jensen, Alec Elías Sigurðarson, Håkon Olav Torvik

This repository contains our code for Project 2 of FYS4150 fall 2021.

# TODO: 
- reimplement choice of integration method (Euler vs RK4)
- do experiment studying convergence rates and error calculation
- do experiment using narrower frequency band, with and without ppi
- do all plotting and looking at results
